## Invoices

An invoice is the core resource for a merchant who wants to accept payments online
using the ProcessOut API. To start using invoices, [let's create one](#create-an-invoice).

### Create an invoice

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/invoices \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d customer_id="cust_LvjCcLOVe6iWn2aeCNhNmK7RbbG6K8XF" \
    -d name="Amazing item" \
    -d statement_descriptor="amazing item" \
    -d amount="4.99" \
    -d currency="USD"
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newInvoice().create({
    customer_id:          "cust_LvjCcLOVe6iWn2aeCNhNmK7RbbG6K8XF",
    name:                 "Amazing item",
    statement_descriptor: "amazing item",
    amount:               "4.99",
    currency:              "USD"
}).then(function(invoice) {
    //

}, function(err) {
    // An error occured

});
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
invoice = client.new_invoice().create({
    "customer_id":          "cust_LvjCcLOVe6iWn2aeCNhNmK7RbbG6K8XF",
    "name":                 "Amazing item",
    "statement_descriptor": "amazing item",
    "amount":               "4.99",
    "currency":              "USD"
})
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
invoice = client.invoice.create(
    "customer_id":        "cust_LvjCcLOVe6iWn2aeCNhNmK7RbbG6K8XF",
    name:                 "Amazing item",
    statement_descriptor: "amazing item",
    amount:               "4.99",
    currency:              "USD"
)
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$invoice = $client->newInvoice()->create(array(
    "customer_id"          => "cust_LvjCcLOVe6iWn2aeCNhNmK7RbbG6K8XF",
    "name"                 => "Amazing item",
    "statement_descriptor" => "amazing item",
    "amount"               => "4.99",
    "currency"              => "USD"
));
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
iv, err := client.NewInvoice().Create(processout.InvoiceCreateParameters{
    Invoice: &processout.Invoice{
        CustomerID:          processout.String("cust_LvjCcLOVe6iWn2aeCNhNmK7RbbG6K8XF"),
        Name:                processout.String("Amazing item"),
        StatementDescriptor: processout.String("amazing item"),
        Amount:              processout.String("4.99"),
        Currency:            processout.String("USD"),
    },
})
```

Creating an invoice for your customers can be done on your server's backend.
Simply create an Invoice resource with a `name`, `amount` and `currency`.

### Fetch an invoice

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %>
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newInvoice().find("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl").then(
    function(invoice) {
        // The invoice was fetched

    }, function(err) {
        // The invoice could not be found
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
invoice = client.new_invoice().find("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
invoice = client.invoice.find("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$invoice = $client->newInvoice()->find("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
iv, err := client.NewInvoice().Find("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl")
```

Invoices can be fetched from ProcessOut by using their IDs. If the invoice
could not be found, an error is thrown.

### Capture an invoice

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl/capture \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d source=card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
// The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
invoice.capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ").then(
    function(transaction) {
        // The invoice was captured and returned a transaction

    }, function(err) {
        // The invoice could not be captured
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
# The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
transaction = invoice.capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
# The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
transaction = invoice.capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
// The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
$transaction = $invoice->capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
// The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
tr, _ := iv.Capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```

Capturing an invoice is done by calling `capture` on the invoice and passing
the `source` to be used to capture the payment in the parameters. If an error
occured while capturing the payment, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the
transaction linked to the invoice is updated and returned.

Be sure to check the [status](/payments/handle-status-changes-webhooks/#transaction-statuses) field of the [Transaction](#transactions)
to make sure the payment fully made it through. If the payment is not yet
completed, we will create new [Events](#events) to keep you updated regarding the status
of the transaction.

Capturing an invoice can be done using a `card`, a [Token](#tokens) or a 
[Gateway request](#).

It is also possible to partially capture a transaction using the `capture_amount` 
flag in the request. However, beware that your PSPs need to support partial
captures as well, otherwise you'll need to to do a full capture followed by a
partial refund to achieve a similar goal.

### Authorize only & auto capture

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl/authorize \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d source=card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ \
    -d auto_capture_at="2022-10-02T15:00:00Z" # optional if you want us to auto capture for you
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
// The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
invoice.authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ", {
    // optional if you want us to auto capture for you
    "auto_capture_at": "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
}).then(
    function(transaction) {
        // The invoice was authorized and returned a transaction

    }, function(err) {
        // The invoice could not be authorized
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
# The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
transaction = invoice.authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ", {
    # optional if you want us to auto capture for you
    "auto_capture_at": "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
})
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
# The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
transaction = invoice.authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ", (
    # optional if you want us to auto capture for you
    auto_capture_at: "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
))
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
// The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
$transaction = $invoice->authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ", array(
    // optional if you want us to auto capture for you
    "auto_capture_at" => "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
));
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
// The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
tr, _ := iv.Authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ", InvoiceAuthorizeParameters{
    AutoCaptureAt: "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z",
})
```

Instead of directly capturing a transaction, it's also possible to execute a
transaction in two phases: the authorization, which confirms and locks the funds on your user's
bank account but without doing the actual money movement, and the capture which initiates
the money settlement.

ProcessOut offers two ways of executing a two-step transaction: either handling the
authorization and capture steps yourself, or performing the authorization and letting us
auto capture the transaction at a later date for you.

To manually capture after an authorization, simply call `capture` endpoint. To set up
the auto capture, you can send the `auto_capture_at` field during the authorization, with the
RFC3339 date at which the auto capture should be performed.

Keep in a mind an authorization usually only lasts for 7 days, after which the capture
may fail.

### Increment authorization

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl/increment_authorization \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %>
    -d amount="10.00"
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
invoice.incrementAuthorization("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl","10.00").then(
    function(transaction) {
        // The authorization amount was incremented and returned a transaction

    }, function(err) {
        // The The authorization amount could not be incremented
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
transaction = invoice.increment_authorization("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl","10.00")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
transaction = invoice.increment_authorization("iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl","10.00")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$transaction = $invoice->incrementAuthorization("10.00");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
tr, _ := iv.IncrementAuthorization("10.00")
```

An existing invoice can be incremented if the PSP provide the feature and the transaction status is authorized.

### Void an invoice

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl/void \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %>
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
// The source could also be a token tok_fKK4btSG7wd13ZZaevzhMcuNbpjcu1Zy
invoice.void().then(
    function(transaction) {
        // The invoice was voided and returned a transaction

    }, function(err) {
        // The invoice could not be voided
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
transaction = invoice.void()
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
transaction = invoice.void()
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$transaction = $invoice->void();
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
tr, _ := iv.Void()
```

Voiding an invoice is meant to cancel a previously authorized transaction (and
can therefore not be done on a transaction that's not with an `authorized` state).

Voiding an invoice is done by calling `void` on the invoice, and doesn't need
any extra parameter. If an error occured while capturing the payment, an error 
is thrown. Otherwise, the transaction linked to the invoice is updated and returned.
